            start producing more. But if you think about it, it is not only this factor leads to the main goal.

            Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a basic need of a manufacturing enterprise.
          </p>
          <p>We can not allow a situation where there is a sudden shortage of any materials or components. This will
            lead to the fact that the order will be executed untimely and, as a result, will severely damage the
            reputation of the enterprise. A surplus of raw materials will lead to irrational consumption of material
            resources, possibly there will be a need for additional storage.</p>
          <p>How to prevent this? Fortunately, we live in a time when there is no need to keep a warehouse, production
            accounting manually, on paper cards. But despite the fact that such a system gives a lot of mistakes, many
            enterprises still use such systems to this day. In the time of technology development, such systems can be
            abandoned.</p>
          <p>What is MRP-system?</p>
          <p>This is a production resource planning system</p>
          <p>It is a separate but synchronized module of the Odoo platform.</p>
          <p>
            Accounting and providing the enterprise with the necessary materials and components is the main task of the
            program, which it copes with perfectly. It automatically regulates the warehouse, balances, expenses and
            receipts, so you will always have everything under control. Finally, you will forget about incidents when
            there is a lack of necessary elements or basic materials for production.</p>

              There are no more restrictions in anything. Moreover, with our system you can make changes. It is possible

              changes depending on your needs.
            </p>
            <p>You can also modify the interface of receiving information. Charts, lists, calendar tables and more -
              choose what is most convenient for you.</p>

            <p>
              Only in this case the system determines the lack of any resources, which allows you to respond to it in a

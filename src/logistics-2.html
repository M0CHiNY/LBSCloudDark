                  A warehouse is a unit in which maximum accuracy is important, moreover, in the correct sequence. Automation in tracking warehouse stocks, the arrival and expenditure goods (raw materials) - will lead to a significant reduction in the time spent on these operations. And this is only a small part of the advantages of Odoo WMS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
The system works on the principle of double entry, which allows you to easily manage warehouse stocks. You have the ability to track the path of movement of goods from the supplier to the customer. That is, the question that some unit of goods lost or disappeared, is excluded by itself. In the system, nothing disappears and is not lost, and the goods are moved from one data storage to another.

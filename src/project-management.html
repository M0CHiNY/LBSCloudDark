                    The project management system integrates with your e-mail, which allows you to instantly respond to customer questions and, based on this, create tasks for employees.
The invoice is issued in a couple of clicks, because it is linked to the contract.
The invoice is issued on the basis of information about the project, costs and after analysis working hours.
Integration with the analytics system will allow you to see the employment of employees in a particular or another project, and if there is a need to redistribute the load. You will also will be able to detect errors in the workflow in a timely manner and correct them.
